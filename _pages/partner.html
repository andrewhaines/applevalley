					<h2>Success Story</h2>
					<p>Chasin’ Axe was founded in Winchester, Virginia (90 minutes from Washington, DC) in August 2020, in the middle of the COVID pandemic. The 2-target axe throwing lounge has a net profit margin of 42-48% and helped the host bar improve their overall customer spend from around $120 to $256 per square foot per year in an otherwise underutilized space. Not only that but it makes for a great talking point and has helped the establishment get huge additional social media and radio coverage.</p>
					<p>This is our proof of concept and a model for a quick-to-market, low-overhead, low build-out cost entertainment facility that taps into a zeitgeist leisure activity.</p>

					<h2>What Is Axe Throwing?</h2>
					<p>According to legend, the first axe throwing competitions were held competitions were held by the frontiersmen in North America, though there have also been reports of axe throwing competitions amongst the Celtic tribes.</p>
					<p>"Urban axe throwing" is a little different. Both a sport and an entertainment activity, it takes place indoors, on a 12’ long range.</p>
					<p>Players take turns to throw their axes in order to get as close to the bullseye, or "kill shot" dots at the top of the target.</p>
